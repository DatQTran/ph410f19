PH410 site


The code for this site depends on:
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (MIT license) and various plugins (jekyll-paginate, jekyll-sitemap, jekyll-gist, jekyll-feed, jekyll-redirect-from, jemoji).
* [AcademicPages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) theme, which was created by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou). That project in turn was a fork from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md.

I've eliminated most of the features from those projects, as my site is much simpler. Anyone is welcome to fork it or use anything on it, but you're probably better off forking from the projects that I took from. The underlying themes and code are governed by the aforementioned license, however my original material on the website is governed by the CC-4.0-NA license where legally permissible and not otherwise specified.
