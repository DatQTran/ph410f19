### Reading Survey 1

Question 1: Have you ever learned about the Dirac delta function in a math or physics class, and could you describe its properties?
Never learned about it; Learned about, can describe; Learned about, can't describe
Question 2: Consider the image of a disk-shaped uniform surface charge density at http://evantilton.com/ph410f19/images/s1-disk.png
Suppose you were asked to find the electric field at point P. According the Griffiths's standard notation, vectors A, B, and C (respectively) should be assigned what names?
r, r', 𝓻; 𝓻, r, r'; 𝓻, r', r; r', r, 𝓻; r, 𝓻, r'
Question 3: What is the magnitude of the separation vector from source point (2,8,7) to field point (4,6,8)?
10.8; 21.4; -3; none of the above
Question 4: What is the gradient of the function f(x,y,z)=x²+y³+z?
x²x̂+y³ŷ+zẑ;2x²x̂+3y³ŷ+zẑ;2xx̂+3yŷ+zẑ;2xx̂+3y²ŷ+zẑ; 2xx̂+3y²ŷ+ẑ
